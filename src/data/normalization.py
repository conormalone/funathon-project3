"""
Compute per-band mean/std from the training tiles.

These statistics must come from the training set (not from each batch) and be
*frozen* afterwards: the same numbers are reused at inference, otherwise the
model sees inputs in a different statistical range from what it learnt on and
predictions degrade silently. The computed values are persisted alongside the
model (MLflow run params) so inference code can restore them exactly.
